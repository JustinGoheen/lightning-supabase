A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) integration for [Lightning AI](https://lightning.ai/docs/app/stable/) Apps.

The integration is a thin abstraction on top of [Supabase-Py](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/python/introduction).

View the docs at: https://lightning-supabase.vercel.app/

Roadmap:

- add support for Supabase buckets
- add support for Supabase PostgreSQL db
- add support for Supabase Deno functions
- add support for realtime: contingent on supabase-py

Supabase Auth may not be included in this integration.
